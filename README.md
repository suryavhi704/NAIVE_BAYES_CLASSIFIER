# 🚀 Email Spam Detection using Naive Bayes Classifier

Welcome to this powerful and precise **Email Spam Detection** project built using the **Naive Bayes Classifier**! This project is the result of an incredible hands-on session conducted by **Intellipaat**, where I explored the magic of probabilistic modeling and transformed theory into a real-world solution. 🔥

## 🧠 What I Learned
This session was a deep dive into the mechanics of the Naive Bayes algorithm and how it can be applied to text classification problems. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts and skills I mastered:

- 📌 **Vectorization Techniques**: Learned how to transform raw text into numerical features using methods like CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer.
- 🛠️ **Model Building**: Built a robust Naive Bayes model (MultinomialNB) from scratch using Scikit-learn.
- 🧪 **Model Testing**: Achieved **99% accuracy** on the test dataset — yes, 99%!
- ✉️ **Spam Detection Application**: Created a fully functional Email Spam Detector that flawlessly predicts spam emails — even with custom, real-world examples!

## 📊 Project Highlights
- 🚀 **Super High Accuracy**: The model consistently scores 99% accuracy on unseen testing data.
- 🎯 **Real-world Validation**: I tested it using my own email samples and it predicted them with astonishing precision.
- ⚙️ **Clean and Efficient Workflow**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Text vectorization
  - Model training & evaluation
  - Custom prediction
